      <h2>My Journey Into Design & Tech</h2>
      <p>
        My undergraduate journey in Mechanical Engineering was nothing short of
        adventurous. As a passionate fan of cars, Iron Man, and sci-fi, I was
        drawn to mechanical engineering with the dream of exploring machines,
        vehicle design, and even space tech. Driving and vehicle aesthetics
        fascinated me deeply, and I was especially interested in how design
        translated into performance. This passion pushed me to participate in
        BAJA SAE India, a prestigious all-terrain vehicle design competition.
        Our team qualified among 30 top teams across India. I took part in
        vehicle design and also managed team tasks like work delegation and
        budgeting, which revealed my knack for team coordination and planning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through various projects and workshops, I discovered a deep interest in
        3D modeling, especially with SolidWorks. However, I also came to terms
        with my physical limitations in tasks like welding and heavy
        fabrication. I realized that my real strength lay in visual design,
        organization, and system thinkingâ€”a more desk-based, creative path that
        combined logic and aesthetics.
      </p>

      <p>
        When COVID-19 disrupted the world, I turned inward and explored other
        creative avenues. I began teaching myself web design, poster creation,
        and basic coding. I also started reading novels and webtoons, which made
        me fall in love with the creative storytelling and artistic aspects of
        tech. Slowly, I realized I could blend my engineering mindset with my
        artistic sideâ€”a perfect fusion of structure and imagination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thatâ€™s when I decided to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science in the
        USA, where I could combine:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ðŸ’¡ My love for problem-solving (thanks to my strong math background)
        </li>
        <li>ðŸŽ¨ My creativity from design and storytelling</li>
        <li>ðŸ’» My growing technical skills in UI/UX, web, and software</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Now, I am transitioning confidently into a career in UI/UX design and
        front-end development, while also upskilling in cloud, machine learning,
        and AI. I came to the U.S. with dreams not just to survive, but to build
        a life where I work with purpose, passion, and impactâ€”every single day.
