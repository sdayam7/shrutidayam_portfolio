      <h2>About Me & My Vision</h2>

      <p>
        Hi, I’m Shruti — a name that means <em>"that which is heard"</em> in
        Sanskrit, rooted in divine knowledge and wisdom. I’ve always been
        someone who questions everything — “Why this?”, “Why not that?” — and
        that curiosity has led me on a unique journey through engineering, art,
        and code.
      </p>

      <p>
        I began with a degree in <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong>, but my
        love for clean design, human behavior, and building experiences led me
        into <strong>UX/UI Design</strong> and
        <strong>Front-End Development</strong>. I’m now focused on offering
        freelance services and building creative tools that solve real-world
        problems with empathy and elegance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond the screen, I’ve always been deeply in love with
        <strong>mathematics</strong>. One of my long-term dreams is to pursue a
        <strong>PhD in Mathematics</strong> and teach advanced concepts on
        <strong>YouTube</strong> — not just for careers, but for the joy of
        learning itself. It’s my way of giving back and inspiring those who love
        numbers like I do.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to the Chinese Zodiac, I’m a <strong>Dragon</strong> — bold,
        passionate, imaginative. While I chase perfection in design and logic, I
        also embrace the emotional ups and downs of creativity. Whether it’s
        solving a user journey or sketching out a UI flow, I pour my whole self
        into the process.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site reflects more than just my skills — it’s a glimpse into who I
        am, what I value, and the future I’m building for myself. Thank you for
        being here 🩵.

      <h2>My Journey Into Design & Tech</h2>
      <p>
        My undergraduate journey in Mechanical Engineering was nothing short of
        adventurous. As a passionate fan of cars, Iron Man, and sci-fi, I was
        drawn to mechanical engineering with the dream of exploring machines,
        vehicle design, and even space tech. Driving and vehicle aesthetics
        fascinated me deeply, and I was especially interested in how design
        translated into performance. This passion pushed me to participate in
        BAJA SAE India, a prestigious all-terrain vehicle design competition.
        Our team qualified among 30 top teams across India. I took part in
        vehicle design and also managed team tasks like work delegation and
        budgeting, which revealed my knack for team coordination and planning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through various projects and workshops, I discovered a deep interest in
        3D modeling, especially with SolidWorks. However, I also came to terms
        with my physical limitations in tasks like welding and heavy
        fabrication. I realized that my real strength lay in visual design,
        organization, and system thinking—a more desk-based, creative path that
        combined logic and aesthetics.
      </p>

      <p>
        When COVID-19 disrupted the world, I turned inward and explored other
        creative avenues. I began teaching myself web design, poster creation,
        and basic coding. I also started reading novels and webtoons, which made
        me fall in love with the creative storytelling and artistic aspects of
        tech. Slowly, I realized I could blend my engineering mindset with my
        artistic side—a perfect fusion of structure and imagination.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s when I decided to pursue a Master’s in Computer Science in the
        USA, where I could combine:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          💡 My love for problem-solving (thanks to my strong math background)
        </li>
        <li>🎨 My creativity from design and storytelling</li>
        <li>💻 My growing technical skills in UI/UX, web, and software</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Now, I am transitioning confidently into a career in UI/UX design and
        front-end development, while also upskilling in cloud, machine learning,
        and AI. I came to the U.S. with dreams not just to survive, but to build
        a life where I work with purpose, passion, and impact—every single day.
