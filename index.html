      <!-- About Me Section -->
      <section id="about">
        <h2>üí´ About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I‚Äôve always loved solving math problems ‚Äî like many Indian students,
          engineering was the natural path for me. As a fan of Iron Man and
          space science fiction, I developed a deep interest in robotics and
          space technology early on.
        </p>
        <p>
          While pursuing my bachelor‚Äôs in Mechanical Engineering at MVSR, I
          explored hands-on design through SolidWorks and participated in
          national-level vehicle competitions. During our final round at
          Chitkara University, I worked on the vehicle‚Äôs braking system and cost
          analysis. That experience helped me discover my strengths: I enjoyed
          designing but felt even more drawn toward understanding logic and
          building intelligent systems.
        </p>
        <h3>üß≠ My Path</h3>
        <p>
          The COVID pandemic gave me the space to explore new skills ‚Äî I took
          part in workshops, internships, and discovered the power of data and
          AI. During an internship on autonomous vehicles, I was amazed by how
          machines could learn and act through just data and training. That
          moment shifted my focus to AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose a master‚Äôs in Computer Science to give myself broader
          opportunities. I wanted to stay in the software field, where I could
          think deeply, work independently, and solve complex problems. I
          explored NLP, Computer Vision, Cloud, and Python ‚Äî and slowly realized
          that AI and Machine Learning were the right fit for my mind and
          passion.
        </p>
        <h3>üéØ My Life Aim</h3>
        <p>
          I aim to grow as an AI/ML developer, build real-world tools, and
          contribute to innovative projects that help people understand or
          interact with the world better ‚Äî like smart assistants, educational
          AI, or vision-based tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in learning every day, and I‚Äôm currently building my own
          tools in NLP and LLMs using LangChain, OpenAI, and HuggingFace. My
          long-term vision is to contribute to impactful AI applications and
          keep learning as the field evolves.
